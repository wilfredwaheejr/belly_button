# Bacterial Data Analysis
## Identifying Improbable Beef
The analysis and visualizations included were drawn from the bacterial data for each volunteer. We are able to look into the top 10 bacterial species in each of their belly buttons. If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, we will be able to see which volunteers had the species in their navel.
